# AutoQuad

I am creating an open source autonomous quadrotor using the Emlid Navio2 Raspberry Pi HAT. There are fully functional alternatives such as ArduPilot that currently exist, but I would like to implement my own using non-linear controls. This is a WIP. Feel free to contribute or fork.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The prerequisites for this project are as follows:

```
Raspberry Pi Model 3 B
4GB+ MicroSD card
Emlid Navio2 HAT
Emlid Linux - you could use normal Raspbian, you just need to install ROS and Navio Drivers. You can also use ArduPilot, but this is meant to be a personal replacement to it.
MAVLink
qgroundcontrol
pigpio
TBD
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
